# Culcita Novum Client

### Introduction
After joining a hackathlon, [Odette Pule](https://github.com/Odett3) and I worked for three intense days full of learning and even though we encountered some challenges along the way, we still emerged victorious and received the first place thanks to a good team work among many other variables. 

### The App
Re-using waste has become more important than ever. It saves tons of waste from ending up in landfills which is actually the worst option of all aside from the ocean due to the methane gas issue (86 times stronger than CO2). Most of what we attempt to recycle by throwing it in our bins is diverted to a landfill anyway so why not try to give it away to someone who might make good use of it?
